Is ‘free’ good?

The first question is: Why would Google buy a software company and then give away its crown jewels?

“The Nik Software team has deep and unique image-processing expertise,” Google told me. “Their technology, coupled with the team’s passion for photography, accelerated our ongoing efforts at Google to deliver a great photo experience.” In other words, it wasn’t the software Google wanted; it was the company’s talent and technology.

The fact is, though, that when one software company acquires another, the acquired company’s wares are usually “end-of-lifed” — in other words, terminated. There’s a very long list of cool apps and programs that are no longer with us because their companies got swallowed up by bigger ones: Persuasion, Tweetie, Picnik, Posterous, Sparrow, Summly, Wavii, Siri (the standalone app), Poster, Meebo, BumpTop 3D, Fridge, SageTV DVR, Lightbox … the list goes on.

So it’s remarkable, brave, and possibly expensive for Google to make the Nik suite available to all, for nothing. It would be simpler to kill off the Nik plug-ins; instead, the company plans to keep them updated for compatibility as operating systems and host programs (Photoshop, Lightroom, and others) evolve.

The second question is: Now that these plug-ins are free, should you download them?

If editing your photos means more to you than just clicking an automatic Fix button, the answer is yes. The Nik tools are complex, but they bring amazing editing power to Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Lightroom, and Aperture as plug-ins. (You can also run the Nix apps as standalone programs, with some limitations.) In many cases, you’ll find them to be more flexible, powerful, and satisfying to use than what Adobe or Apple provides out of the box.
